# ME239
Purdue University ME239: Intro to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers programs and work. Work for all assignments was done as Jupyter notebook files edited through Google Colab.

I took this course the first semseter it was offered (Fall 2025) in my third semester at Purdue. Starting with a relatively solid understanding of python through ENGR 161/162 the intro assignments were found to be relatively easy. Once more complicated concepts of data science were introduced through later homework assignments it became more difficult.

Storing through github as a bit of a side project to understand how to use github better, due to the default saving feature through google colab to save jupyter notebooks to github, and just for fun.
